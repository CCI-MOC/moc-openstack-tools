MOC OPENSTACK HELPDESK INTERFACE

Brief instructions for helpdesk operators.

## Available MOC Commands:
From this account you should be able to run the following commands:

    $ moc grant-access --user <USERNAME>
        Process access requests from the specified user.

    $ moc help
        Display this message.

    $ moc reset-password <username> <4-digit-pin>
        Generates a link that an existing user can use to reset their password,
        and sends the link via email to the address associated with the user account.
        NOTE: For security, this link should not be sent to any other email address.

    $ moc update-quotas --project <PROJECT>
        Process the quota update request for the specified project.


## Access Requests

Once an access request ticket is received, log into the helpdesk VM and type:

     $ moc grant-access --user <USERNAME>

The username will be provided in the ticket and will be an email address.


## Resetting passwords:

The ticket will contain the OpenStack username and a 4 digit PIN.  Log into the
helpdesk VM and type:

    $ moc reset-password <USERNAME> <PIN>

This will email a link to the user which they can use to reset their password.
The email will be sent to the email address associated with their OpenStack
account.  In most cases this also their OpenStack username.

The link is only sent to the email address on file for the user, and should not
be sent to any other address.  If the user says they do not receive the email, or
asks for the link sent to be sent to a different email account for any reason,
please assign the ticket to an MOC staff member.


## Updating quotas

When a quota request ticket is received, log into the helpdesk VM and type:

    $ moc update-quotas --project <PROJECT>

The project name is provided in the ticket.


## Something is not working right

Please assign the ticket to MOC Staff, and include any tracebacks or error
output to help us fix the problem.
