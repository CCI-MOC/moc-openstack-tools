Hi <USER>,

A user account and project have been created for you on MOC Production (Kaizen).  You can log in at:
https://controller-0.kaizen.massopencloud.org

Your username is "<USERNAME>", and your project is "<PROJECTNAME>".  You will receive a separate email with a link to set your password. The link will expire after 24 hours, so please act promptly.

Some information on getting started with OpenStack can be found here:
https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-public/wiki/Getting-started

Some important things to note:

1.   We have listed our default quotas/limitations for the projects below this email.  If any of these will cause problems for your work, let us know what your needs are and we will try to accommodate if possible.

2.  For security, our base OS images do not have a default login password.  We strongly suggest you create one immediately after creating a VM in case you need to access the console via the Openstack web dashboard.  Please choose a secure password.

3.  VM images are stored in Ceph, which is a reliable, replicated storage solution.  However, we do not currently maintain any backups outside of our Ceph cluster.  We recommend that you make separate backups of any critical data in your VMS.

If you encounter any issues with your account or project, please send an email to:
moc-kaizen-l@bu.edu

Thanks.

LIMITATIONS:
non-admin access only
only CentOS and Ubuntu images can be uploaded
